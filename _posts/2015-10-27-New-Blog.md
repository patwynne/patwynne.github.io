Hi all! I hope to use this blog primarily to keep notes on my projects, but hopefully some others stumble across upon my work and find it interesting. Lets see how this goes!

This is my new blog built using Jekyll. Special thanks to Barry Clarks   [tutorial!](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
