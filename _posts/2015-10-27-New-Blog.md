Hi all! This is my new blog built using Jekyll (or Jekyll Now?). Special thanks to Barry Clarks   [tutorial!](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) I hope to use this blog primarily to keep notes on my projects, but hopefully some others stumble across upon my work and find it interesting. 

Lets see how this goes!
