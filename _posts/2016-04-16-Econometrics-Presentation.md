I was recently asked to speak to a finance class about R, and decdied to use the [revealjs](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs) package to create my slides. Personally one of my favorite aspects of R is using knitr/rmarkdown to create dynamic documents that output beautiful html or pdf files. 

Using the revealjs package was pretty straightforward. I did however hit stumbling block trying to get github pages to serve an .html file rather than processing a .md, but including the .nojekyll file seems to have done the trick.

The final slides can seen [here](http://patwynne.me/econometricsPresentation/) and the source code for the slides is available at the [repository](https://github.com/patwynne/econometricsPresentation)

As an quick explainer for the slides, I had an hour to speak to the students about R. I decided to list some potential problems with spreadsheets (finance loves their spreadsheets). After that I helped the students install R and R Studio on their machines before going over a couple quick examples. We were a little tight on time, but it was definitely a fun experience!
