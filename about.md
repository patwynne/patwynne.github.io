I am an institutional research analyst at Queensborough Community College as well as a grad student in the data analytics program at Queens College. I am interested in R, statistics, and data visualization.

A big thank you to [Barry Clark](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for his tutorial and code which got this blog off the ground.
